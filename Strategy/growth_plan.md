# Skymirror Academy Growth Plan

This document outlines a foundational marketing and operational strategy to help Skymirror Academy scale efficiently and establish a world-class reputation.

## Part 1: Marketing & Brand Strategy

Our marketing should be lean, authentic, and focused on our core value proposition: mentorship and job-readiness.

*   **Target Audience**: Primarily focus on career switchers and recent graduates within the European Union. This group is motivated, has a clear goal (employment), and aligns with our course offerings.

*   **Core Messaging**: Emphasize **"World-class mentorship, real-world projects."** This is our key differentiator against larger, more impersonal platforms. Every piece of marketing material should echo this.

*   **Content Marketing**: This is the most cost-effective way to build authority and attract organic traffic.
    *   __Blog__: Regularly publish articles on topics our target audience is searching for (e.g., "Is a tech career right for me?", "Frontend vs. Backend Developer in 2025", "How to build a project portfolio that gets you hired").
    *   __Free Workshops__: Host monthly 1-hour online workshops on introductory topics (e.g., "Intro to React," "Building Your First API"). This builds community, showcases teaching quality, and captures qualified leads.
    *   __Success Stories__: Turn student projects and job placements into detailed case studies. Feature them prominently on the website and in social media.

*   **Community Building**:
    *   __Discord/Slack Server__: Create a public channel for prospective students to ask questions and interact with the community. This builds trust and a sense of belonging before they even enroll.
    *   __Local Meetups__: Start small with informal meetups in Budapest, then potentially other European tech hubs. This reinforces the "Made in Europe" identity.

*   **Paid Advertising (When Ready)**:
    *   __LinkedIn Ads__: Target users by job title, current company, skills, and educational background. Ideal for reaching professionals looking to switch careers.
    *   __Google Ads__: Focus on long-tail, high-intent keywords like "best online backend bootcamp Europe" or "part-time data science course Hungary."

## Part 2: Lean Operational Plan

To run a world-class yet efficient academy, we can phase our hiring. The key is to leverage contractors and automation to stay lean.

### Phase 1: Founding Team (1-3 People)

This is the core team to get the academy to its first ~50-100 students.

*   **The Visionary / Lead Instructor (1 person)**:
    *   __Responsibilities__: Sets the curriculum vision, teaches the primary cohorts, creates video content, and acts as the public "face" of the academy. This is likely the founder.

*   **Operations & Admissions Lead (1 person)**:
    *   __Responsibilities__: Manages the admissions pipeline, student onboarding, payment processing, community management, and day-to-day operational tasks. This person is the organizational backbone.

*   **Part-Time Mentors (Contractors)**:
    *   __Strategy__: This is our most important strategic advantage. Instead of hiring many expensive full-time instructors, we recruit a network of accomplished industry experts as paid, part-time mentors. This provides the "world-class" experience scalably.
    *   __Recruitment__: Find them on LinkedIn, at tech conferences, and through personal networks.

### Phase 2: Scaling Team (4-7 People)

As student numbers grow beyond what the founding team can handle personally.

*   **Full-Time Instructors (2-3)**:
    *   __Responsibilities__: Hire dedicated instructors for the most popular programs (e.g., one for Frontend, one for Backend). They lead cohorts, grade assignments, and support the Lead Instructor.

*   **Career Services Manager (1 person)**:
    *   __Responsibilities__: Dedicated to building a network of hiring partners, coaching students on job-seeking skills, and tracking employment outcomes. This role is critical for backing up our job placement claims.

*   **Marketing & Community Manager (1 person)**:
    *   __Responsibilities__: Takes over the content marketing, social media, paid ads, and community management from the Operations Lead, allowing them to focus purely on students.

This lean, phased approach ensures we don't over-hire while still delivering the high-quality, mentor-driven experience that will make Skymirror Academy a world-class institution.
